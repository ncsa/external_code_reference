NCSA External Code Reference Page
==================================================

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :glob:

   *

This page tree contains reference pages for applications that were developed externally to NCSA, but that we have used on our systems enough that we have reference documents for building and/or installing on our systems.  These pages are generally not to document the codes themselves (we assume they have their own documentation elsewhere), but to document how we installed them, or how users could get access to them.  

Some of these pages are current, but many of them arent, and are placed here as historical reference.  Each code page should have information at the top with the last time it was modified and if it's up to date on any current NCSA sytems.
